# Test-Extension
Simple Test extension<br>
Plan: Create contextmenu that opens up a side panel that displays graph of the frequency of words in highlighted text.<br>
New Idea: Put testpanel html into sandbox and then figure out how to communicate between sandbox, else check Google Charts.<br>
Uses code from the Chart.js library.
